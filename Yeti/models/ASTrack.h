/**
 Tracks are the heart of the platform, and represent a playable piece of music.
 Methods for Searching and streaming tracks are documented in detail above.
 For speedy results, many track attributes are omitted when searching via
 an ASPaginator. However by using the 'with' parameter when performing a
 search additional attributes or their ids can be retrieved. See
 [the Audiosocket searching API docs](http://develop.audiosocket.com/v5-api#searching)
 for more details on the 'with' parameter. All attributes can be retrieved from the
 trackâ€™s /tracks/:id singular resource.

 Many of the track properties are a list of ids. These IDs can be 'resolved' by
 using the ASContext. Typically you'll want to load the context once then resolve
 ids using:

       NSArray *genres = [context resolveIDs:track.genreIDs forClass:[ASGenre class]];
